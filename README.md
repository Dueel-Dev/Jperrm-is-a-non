# Chatroom
A simple web-based chatroom implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The server can be launched using the command `node server.js` in the system's command line interface. The chat room is hosted at '_localhost:8080_' in the web browser. The chat automatically stores message history as long as the server is running. Anyone else on the same wifi can access the chatroom at '_host serve IPv4 address:8080_' in their browser.
