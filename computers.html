        I like computers. I find it realy iteresting how each component interacts with each other component. It's realy amazing how far computers have come in the past years. Ten years ago computers struggled with now trivial tasks and now we see computers doing things like real time ray traceing. It's truly amazing what technolagy has come to in recent years.
